## 14erEngine v1

### Lightweight 3D Game Engine

#### By 14er

A very simple 3d game engine I made just to see if I could. Not a whole lot interesting, but it does work (complete with rendering, physics, objects, etc).

## Dependencies

stbimage, glfw, GLEW, OpenGL

## Compiling

Sorry, no help yet.
